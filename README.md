Scaffolar 2
===========

The AngularJS' scaffolding tool for single page websites.

This project is an application skeleton for a typical AngularJS web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

Scaffolar contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

Scaffolar doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.
